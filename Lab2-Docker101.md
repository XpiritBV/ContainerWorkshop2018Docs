# Lab 2 - Docker 101

In this lab you will become more familiar with the Docker command-line interface (CLI). 

Goals for this lab: 
- [Inspect Docker environment on local machine](#inspect)
- [Manage container images and instances](#manage)
- [Working with container images](#working)

## <a name="inspect"></a>Inspect your Docker environment
Let's check whether your Docker Community Edition tooling is correctly set up. Also, you might need to get familiar with the Docker tooling.

You should see the Docker tooling running. On Windows, you can check this by looking for a tray icon like this:

![](images/dockertray.png)

If you cannot find the Docker icon in the tray, you might need to start the Docker tooling. After starting the Docker tooling you should see the following dialog:

<img src="images/dockerrunning.png" height="500"/>

Start a Developer Command Prompt and run the following commands:

```
docker --version
docker version
docker info
docker images
```
Verify that your installation functions correctly. You should get see the current version of the tooling and information on the client and server. The output for the first two commands might be similar to the following.

Tooling version:
```
Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a
```

Client and server information:
```
Client:
 Version:           18.06.1-ce
 API version:       1.38
 Go version:        go1.10.3
 Git commit:        e68fc7a
 Built:             Tue Aug 21 17:21:34 2018
 OS/Arch:           windows/amd64
 Experimental:      false

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:          18.06.1-ce
  API version:      1.38 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.3
  Git commit:       e68fc7a
  Built:            Tue Aug 21 17:29:02 2018
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     false   
```
## <a name="manage"></a>Managing container instances
Let's see whether you can start some container instances. The categorical sample is "Hello World". Start a container that should run if everything is configured correctly. From a command prompt, run the following command:
```
docker run hello-world
```
This should output a message that starts with the following:
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
```
Run `docker ps` to see if there are any running container instances. It might return an empty result:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```
This is because the `hello-world` container instance has already stopped after producing the console output. To see stopped containers change the previous docker command to, use `docker ps -a` to output all container instances, running and stopped.

Next, start a new container with:
```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /opt/portainer:/data portainer/portainer
```
Navigate to http://localhost:9000 and create a login for your local machine. Choose to manage the local machine. The management UI might come in useful to manage Docker on your machine.

Search the Docker Hub for public images. Try searching for `ngingx` which is a reverse proxy.
```
docker search nginx
docker pull nginx
docker run -it --name docker-nginx -p 8090:80 nginx
```

The last command seems to block. That's okay. Navigate to http://localhost:8090. You will notice that the output of the nginx container is now filling the console. The prompt is missing. This is because you are now attached to the container. To detach use the key combination `Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q` to detach from the container and return to the prompt.
Inspecting the running containers with `docker ps`, you should find that the nginx container is still running.

Next, start a container to run an instance of SQL Server on Linux. 
The image for SQL Server for Linux is located in the Docker Store, since it is an official image. Navigate to http://store.docker.com and search for SQL Server there. Pull the image when you found its name:
```
docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux
```

Use the command:
```
docker run -d -p 5433:1433 --env ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e SA_PASSWORD="Pass@word" --env MSSQL_PID=Developer --name sqldocker microsoft/mssql-server-linux
```
The SQL Server container is started detached, so it will not show any output other than the container ID:
```
70e944041df92c7e5c12217e98683a11f85eb480288cacc2b50888504366b0af
```
You can refer to this container by its ID or its name `sqldocker`. You do not have to specify the entire container ID for commands with the Docker CLI. It is sufficient to provide enough characters from the start to give a unique match. In the example above this would be `7` or `70` or `70e`, depending on the IDs of other containers.

You can still examine the output of the container even though it is detached from the console. Simply run `docker logs <containerid>`, substituting the ID of the container, like so:
```
docker logs 70e
```
Examine the contents of the master database by adding a Data Connection in the Server Explorer. The database connection details are:
- Server: 127.0.0.1,5433 (notice the comma instead of a colon)
- Username: sa
- Password: Pass@word

<img src="images/AddDataConnection.png" width="400" />

Inspect the running containers again with `docker ps`. 

Stop and remove the `nginx` container with these commands:
```
docker stop docker-nginx
docker ps -a
docker rm docker-nginx
```

Do the same for the `hello-world` container by using its container ID or the generated two-part name, which is something like `loving_newton`.

## <a name="working"></a>Working with container images
By running the examples above you will have downloaded some container images. You can see which ones are available on your machine by the following command:
```
docker images
```
Remove the image `hello-world`:
``` 
docker rmi hello-world
```
## Wrapup
You have just learned some of the basic commands in the Docker CLI to manage both container instances and images. There is a lot more to discover with Docker commands, but you will encounter this during the rest of the labs.

Keep the container with the SQL Server developer instance running, as we will need it in the next lab.
